# Neuro-genetic pathways
Standardised pathway annotations for use in genetics of brain disorders.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of a comprehensive pipeline for downloading, processing, and standardizing genetic pathway data. Our goal is to provide researchers and enthusiasts with easy access to genetic pathways in a standardized format, making it simpler to integrate and compare data across different studies and genome builds.

The pipeline is designed to automate the liftover process to different genome builds, ensuring that the data is accessible and usable regardless of the reference genome version. Additionally, we provide versions of the data with and without the APOE region, catering to various research needs and preferences.

**Please note:** This project is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing and refining the pipeline and its documentation. Feedback and contributions are highly welcomed!
